Movie Recommendation Engine using Python, Cosine Similarity

Ever wonder how Netflix, Prime Video and other such services recommend movies which are almost always to your liking.

I wondered the same, when I was binge-watching web shows. So I explored and I built an engine which takes into account a humongous movie database from IMDb and considers everything from Cast, Directors, Genre, Ratings, and much more.

It uses a mathematical model which is based on Cosine Similarity.

Cheers!
